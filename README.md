# Internal Audit Project: User Access & IAM Review

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **Quarterly User Access Review** for a production database. As a GRC Analyst, I performed an audit of active user accounts against HR termination records and the corporate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) matrix.

## Objectives
* Identify **Orphaned Accounts** (terminated employees with active access).
* Detect **Privilege Creep** (users with excessive Admin rights).
* Evaluate the **Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML)** process against **NIST SP 800-53** and **ISO 27001** standards.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Control Testing:** Verifying account statuses and permission levels.
* **Risk Assessment:** Categorizing findings by severity (High/Med/Low).
* **Remediation Planning:** Developing a Management Action Plan with realistic deadlines.
* **Technical Writing:** Producing a professional Audit Memo for C-suite stakeholders.

* ## Audit Methodology
To ensure a comprehensive review, I followed the standard Internal Audit lifecycle:
1. **Planning:** Defined the audit scope (Production Database) and identified relevant controls (NIST AC-2).
2. **Fieldwork:** Conducted a gap analysis by comparing HR 'Leaver' reports against system 'Active' user logs.
3. **Reporting:** Documented control deficiencies, assigned risk ratings, and identified root causes (JML process failures).
4. **Remediation:** Drafted actionable recommendations for the IT department to close identified security gaps.
